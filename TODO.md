# TODO

- Responsive: adapt the page for mobile breakpoints; verify charts and tables shrink gracefully.
- Leaderboard: add top-3 lists for sustained, burst, and value pick, with clear labeling.
- Layout parity: style the leaderboard to match the quick-recharge and full-recharge patterns, reusing components where possible.
